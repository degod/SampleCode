## About Prokip Network Partnerships

The goal of the partnership app is to manage our partners through a multi level marketing structure where a partner can recruit another partner and earn from that partners sales and recruitments up to 3 generations 

#### Eg: 

- Partner A sign ups Partner B 
- And then Partner B signups Partner C 
- And then Partner C signups Partner D 

### Commission Structure

The commission pattern is in a matrix. That means Partner A will earn from partner B, C & D in commissions structure as seen below:

- Partner B = 5% on each sales and recruit 
- Partner C = 3% on each sales and recruit 
- Partner D = 2% on each sales and recruit 

While the above shows what a Partner  can earn from the partners registers 

For each sales of the Software they generates He gets commissions based on the package the partner registers with. 

### Types of Partners

There are 3 packages in the partnership 

- **Standard**  (30% on every sales)
- **Elite**           
- **Investor**
